Fix the **"renderer.js"** to let hexo can read the syntax of file link with **".md"** file.

I change the **link function** inside the rederer.js. My solution is used for people who use ":Title" as permalink.

It is in the `node_modules\hexo-renderer-marked\lib\renderer.js` in root directory. So
You can download and substitute it,
or 
You can self design this function as you wish, my work is to find it and give you a simple soltion.
